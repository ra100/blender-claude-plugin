# Blender Shader Nodes Expert

## Overview

This skill provides expert guidance for Blender 5.x shader nodes: designing material setups, writing Python scripts to build shader node trees programmatically, understanding render engine differences (Cycles vs EEVEE), and accessing the complete shader node catalog. The reference files contain the full node listing and Python API patterns.

## MCP-First Approach

When a Blender MCP server is available in the environment, prefer using it for direct interaction with Blender (creating materials, modifying node trees, reading scene data). Fall back to generating Python scripts when MCP is unavailable.

To check for Blender MCP availability, search available tools for "blender" at the start of a session.

## Task Decision Tree

- **"Create a material for X"** -> Identify the material type, design the node tree, generate Python code (see Material Recipes)
- **"My material looks wrong"** -> Follow the Debugging workflow
- **"What node does X?"** -> Consult `references/node_reference.md`
- **"Set up world lighting / HDRI"** -> See World/Environment pattern in Python API reference
- **"Script a shader node tree"** -> Consult `references/python_api.md` for API patterns
- **"Cycles vs EEVEE?"** -> Check the Render Engine Compatibility section in node_reference.md

## Generating Shader Node Trees

When creating materials via Python:

1. Read `references/python_api.md` for the correct API patterns and node type strings
2. Structure the script following this pattern:
   - Create the material with `use_nodes = True`
   - Clear default nodes
   - Add all nodes with correct type strings
   - Position nodes left-to-right (x spacing ~300, y spacing ~200)
   - Set default values on inputs
   - Create all links between nodes
   - Assign material to the target object
3. Use Frame nodes to organize complex setups into logical sections

### Node Type String Conventions

- Most shader nodes: `ShaderNode<PascalCaseName>` (e.g., `ShaderNodeBsdfPrincipled`, `ShaderNodeTexNoise`)
- Geometry input: `ShaderNodeNewGeometry` (not `ShaderNodeGeometry`)
- Color attribute: `ShaderNodeVertexColor`
- Mix node: `ShaderNodeMix` with `data_type` set to `'RGBA'`, `'FLOAT'`, or `'VECTOR'`
- Color Ramp: `ShaderNodeValToRGB`
- When uncertain about the exact type string, consult `references/python_api.md`

## Material Recipes

### PBR Material (Texture-Based)
1. Texture Coordinate -> Mapping -> Image Texture(s) -> Principled BSDF -> Material Output
2. Connect maps: Base Color (sRGB), Roughness (Non-Color), Metallic (Non-Color), Normal Map (Non-Color) -> Normal Map node -> Normal input
3. Set non-color images to `image_tex.image.colorspace_settings.name = 'Non-Color'`

### Procedural Material
1. Texture Coordinate -> Noise/Voronoi/Wave Texture -> Color Ramp -> Principled BSDF
2. Layer multiple textures using Mix nodes for complexity
3. Use Separate XYZ on Texture Coordinate for axis-dependent patterns

### Glass / Transparent
1. Principled BSDF with Transmission Weight = 1.0, Roughness = 0.0 (clear) or >0 (frosted), IOR = 1.45-1.52
2. Alternative: Glass BSDF node for simpler setup
3. EEVEE: Enable Screen Space Refraction on material and render settings

### Metal
1. Principled BSDF with Metallic = 1.0, Base Color = metal tint (gold: 1.0, 0.766, 0.336), Roughness = 0.1-0.4
2. Alternative (5.0): Metallic BSDF node for physically accurate complex IOR
3. Add fingerprints/scratches: mix Roughness with procedural texture

### Skin / Subsurface
1. Principled BSDF with Subsurface Weight = 0.3-1.0, Subsurface Radius = (1.0, 0.2, 0.1) for RGB scattering
2. Connect skin texture to Base Color, detail normal map to Normal
3. Cycles: Use Random Walk method for best quality

### Emission / Neon
1. Principled BSDF with Emission Color = desired color, Emission Strength = 1-50+
2. Or standalone Emission node -> Material Output (Surface)
3. Enable Bloom in render settings (EEVEE) for glow effect

### Toon / Cel Shading (EEVEE)
1. Principled BSDF (or any BSDF) -> Shader to RGB -> Color Ramp (Constant interpolation) -> Material Output (via Emission or custom output)
2. Color Ramp stops create discrete shading bands
3. Shader to RGB is EEVEE-only

### World / HDRI Environment
1. Environment Texture (load .exr/.hdr) -> Background -> World Output
2. Add Mapping node between Texture Coordinate (Generated) and Environment Texture for rotation
3. Set Background Strength for intensity

### Displacement
1. Texture -> Displacement node -> Material Output (Displacement socket)
2. Set material displacement method: `mat.cycles.displacement_method = 'BOTH'`
3. Requires subdivision on the mesh (Subdivision Surface modifier or Adaptive Subdivision in Cycles)

### Volume (Fog/Smoke)
1. Principled Volume -> Material Output (Volume socket)
2. Or: Volume Absorption + Volume Scatter -> Add Shader -> Material Output (Volume)
3. Set Density, Color, Anisotropy

## Debugging & Optimization

### Common Visual Issues

- **Material appears black**: Check that Material Output has a valid Surface connection. Verify the object has UV coordinates if textures require them
- **Material appears white/flat**: Missing texture connections or all textures set to wrong color space
- **Glass/transparency not working in EEVEE**: Enable Screen Space Refraction in both render settings and material settings. Set blend mode to Alpha Hashed or Alpha Blend
- **Normal map looks bumpy/wrong**: Ensure normal map image is set to Non-Color color space. Check that Normal Map node is set to correct space (Tangent for most cases)
- **Texture stretching**: Object needs proper UV unwrap. Alternatively, use Object or Generated texture coordinates with Mapping node
- **Fireflies in Cycles render**: Reduce light bounces, use Clamp Direct/Indirect in render settings, or denoise

### Performance Tips

1. **Principled BSDF over separate shaders**: The Principled BSDF is optimized internally; combining Diffuse + Glossy + Glass manually is slower
2. **Minimize texture resolution**: Use 2K textures for most cases, 4K only when close-up detail is needed
3. **Avoid excessive Noise Texture stacking**: Each noise computation is expensive. Bake complex procedural textures for animation
4. **EEVEE screen-space effects**: Screen Space Reflections, Refraction, and SSS add per-material cost. Only enable on materials that need them
5. **Simplify for viewport**: Use lower texture resolution or simpler shaders in viewport preview mode
